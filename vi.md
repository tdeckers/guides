# VI(M) tips and tricks

Most of these commands/features can be turned off by prefixing them with `no`.

# Configurations

To configure this custom vimrc and Vundle on a host, run:
`bash < <(curl -s -L https://github.com/tdeckers/guides/raw/master/vi-install.sh)`

## Set when needed

* `set columns=80` : set window column width to 80 (or something else)
* `set number` : set line numbers
* `set paste` : paste content without auto inserting stuff (turn off after pasting)
